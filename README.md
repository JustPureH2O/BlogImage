## Prologue

This is a image storage for [my website](https://justpureh2o.cn). Using Vercel, it runs very smoothly and efficiently especially in CHN Mainland. Fonts and my scripts are well stored in this repo.

## Structure

"fonts" folder is used to keep webfonts literally. All files are formatted in .woff2 in order to reduce size.

"store" folder is a legacy inherited from old GitHub repo, where my crack scripts are uploaded to. ~~I'm just too lazy to revise my previous code...~~

"package" folder enables you to upload software packages, such as game files for my classmates to play, and vital files that need to be transferred all way round.

Others are under construction...

## Epilogue

Maybe someday this repo will be joined by other participants who show an interest in co-constructing the blog, but in a short time I won't let this be true out of safety concerns, so it might be just an imaginary outlook...
